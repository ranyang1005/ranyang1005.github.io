Recently, I saw an interview of Julia Roberts, in which she describe Mahjong as below:
> The concept of it is to create order out of chaos based on random drawing of tiles.


To tell the truth, I really cannot understand why she can think it in such a way. I am not sure whether she learn something from someone. What I really want to learn is whether the education she have teach her think in such a way.
