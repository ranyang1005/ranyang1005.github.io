There is a *Yau Class* in the Middle School Attached To NWPU, which is designed for maths genius. Frankly speaking, though Sam is good at maths in a common sense, I think there is an obvious gap between him and maths genius. Anyway, taking a try is not a waste of time, so I would like to help him to take a try.

As one of the preperation, I read the autobiography of Yau, which is named as *The Shape of a Life*. I listed things which impressed me greatly:
- Environment is important. Though the economic status of Yau's family is not good, he still have the chance to visit USA. I donot think it is possible in current China.
- Cooperation is important. Most achievements comes from cooperation and discussion.
- Yau has a good foundation on conventional Chinese culture. I cannot understand well for several of his quotation during talk.
- I think one purpose of his autobiography is to clarify some rumors, including his relationship between Prof. Chern. In the book, Yau is perfect and blameless, but I donot think it is possible.
