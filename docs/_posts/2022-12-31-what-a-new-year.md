It is time to say *Happy new year!*, but I am not happy.

My wife has a biz trip this week, and she has not come back until now. 
She even doesnot tell me anything about the biz trip.

Maybe I should contact her to ask whether she is OK, but I cannot.

She doesnot show any needed respect. I donnot know why a call or a message is not impossible in the past week. Under the circumstance, I donot know what should be said to her.

The only thing she care is money. When she want to say something to me, it relates with money in 90 percent. She give up any respect to me because she think she earns more money than me.

She doesnot care about my feelings, she doesnot care about my health, she doesnot care about her son, and she doesnot care about whether it is a home or not.

I think I lost my wife for ever.
