I want to only read original edition in future. There are three reasons.
- It comes from some blogs, saying [CoolShell](https://coolshell.cn/)
- When I tried to translate some interesting things into Chinese, I cannot express all I want to say. I believe most translators donot have higher ability. My experience in reading translated books also give my evidence.


Reading original edition means I will only read Chinese books writen by Chinese authors, and English books. I think it is enough. Omitting others is acceptable for me.


The next question is how to buy English original book, I think I will try Amazon on iPad. If it doesnot work, I donot have a good idea by now. Buying a physical English original book becomes more challenging after COVID-19.
