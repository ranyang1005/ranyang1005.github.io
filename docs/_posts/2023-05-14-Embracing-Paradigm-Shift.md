In the past three years, I felt my body ruined faster than ever. On every weekday, I slept for only five hours. In company, there are many annoying things to handle. After that, I run back home as fast as possible, because I have to help my son to finish his homework in a short time to ensure he can sleep eight hours a day. I gave up a lot of my personal time.


However, nobody really appreciate what I have done. My son hates me, my wife think it is simply my duty and criticized once anything happen. For example, if my son is unsatisifed with something related me, it is my fault.


I am frustrated. In the past weeks, I give up checking his homework. If he doesnot want to do it, it is OK. Today, his mother takes him to play with his classmate, it is PM nine now and he is still outside . I have not called them to come back. On the contrary, I speed the whole day for myself: learn some algorithms, listen to a talk about OpenAI and ChatGPT, walk for several hours around our home. I felt relaxed.


In the talk from Lu Qi, he emphized that a new paradigm shift has occurred with large models. For me, it is also a new paradigm. I need to find a new way to face my son, to face my wife, and to face myself.


After several weeks, the relationship between my son and me becomes better. Today his teacher sent an image to me and tell me he cannot read what my son wrote. I havenot mention it before he finished his homework. After he finished his homework, I invited him to walk outside though it is time for him to sleep. He asked to have an icecream and I bought one. I told him the importance of writing and he accepted it. Look, it is not hard for me to manage our relationship.


Let me summarize the secret which I told my son and he cannot retort. I will not be the source of unpleasant things if I donot care about his study, his eight-hour sleep and going to school on time.


It is common in all family, however, why it is hard and even not possible for me? No one really support me in the family.
