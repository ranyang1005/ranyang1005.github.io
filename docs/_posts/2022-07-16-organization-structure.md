It is the script for my representation in English training.


There are three major structures for an orgnization, which is hierachical, matrix and flat. 


Hierarchical strucutre is the most intuitive and popular ones. The whole orgnization is divided into several big departments, which take charge of different functions. And each big department will be further divided into small departments. It may be repeated several times. The smallest one may be a project. The project leader will build up a team with about eight members.


As time went on, it is found hierarchical structure may not be effective, so new structures emerge. The most famous one may be matrix structure. Here is an example. Saying you are a web developer, so your leader will be responsible for a specified technical fields, frontend or backend. If a project is started, the project leader will asked each technical leader to give some developers to him. Then he will have a team which has members of both backend and frontend engineers. With matrix structure, you donnot have to have a frontend engineer for each project, you can share the resource, so it seems more effective than the hierachical struture.


Flat structure are more popular in internet companies. The philosopy is the decision should come from those can hear the guns, because they know the situation best. In this orgnization, may mid management are eliminated.


It is hard to classify a big company to one of the structures because maybe all of them will be adopted. If we check the overall strucures, it may be hierarchical one. However, the largest development department of it may use matrix strucutre. Their sale department may use flat strucutre.

That is all about the organization strucutre which I knows. Thanks.
