Someone said you should treat everyday to be the last day of you, so you can always focus on the most important things.

I follows it, but I found it is totally wrong.

Long term goal and short term goal are totally different. You will choose a totally differnt policy if you doonot have enough time, which is not true.


Today, I regretted to what I have done in the past two years. Frankly speaking, I should have a better methods.

Just now, Paulo Maldini was sacked by Redbird. I found some similarity between us.

Both of us cannot accept mediocrity.

The biggest difference is his life will not be impacted too much though he lost his job.

I donot have a conclusion by now.

Act as a man is what I want to say to myself now.
